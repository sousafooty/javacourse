        <h3>The Most Widely Used Java Libraries</h3>
        <p>
        A typical Java project relies on third-party libraries.
        This page summarizes the most popular and widely used Java libraries for a variety of different applications.
        A simple example is also provided for some of them, if it can be found on <a href="https://www.programcreek.com/">ProgramCreek.</a></p>

        <p>Java SDK is surely the #1 widely used library. So the focus of this list is the popular third-party libraries.
        The list may not not perfect.</p>
